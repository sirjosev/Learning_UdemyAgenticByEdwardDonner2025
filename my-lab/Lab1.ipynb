            I try to send emails regularly with important updates related to the course. You can find this in the 'Announcements' section of Udemy in the left sidebar.

### New to Notebooks like this one? Head over to the guides folder!

Just to check you've already added the Python and Jupyter extensions to Cursor, if not already installed:
- Open extensions (View >> extensions)
- Search for python, and when the results show, click on the ms-python one, and Install it if not already installed
- Search for jupyter, and when the results show, click on the Microsoft one, and Install it if not already installed  
Then View >> Explorer to bring back the File Explorer.

And then:
1. Click where it says "Select Kernel" near the top right, and select the option called `.venv (Python 3.12.9)` or similar, which should be the first choice or the most prominent choice. You may need to choose "Python Environments" first.
2. Click in each "cell" below, starting with the cell immediately below this text, and press Shift+Enter to run
3. Enjoy!

After you click "Select Kernel", if there is no option like `.venv (Python 3.12.9)` then please do the following:  
1. On Mac: From the Cursor menu, choose Settings >> VS Code Settings (NOTE: be sure to select `VSCode Settings` not `Cursor Settings`);  
On Windows PC: From the File menu, choose Preferences >> VS Code Settings(NOTE: be sure to select `VSCode Settings` not `Cursor Settings`)  
2. In the Settings search bar, type "venv"  
3. In the field "Path to folder with a list of Virtual Environments" put the path to the project root, like C:\Users\username\projects\agents (on a Windows PC) or /Users/username/projects/agents (on Mac or Linux).  
And then try again.

Having problems with missing Python versions in that list? Have you ever used Anaconda before? It might be interferring. Quit Cursor, bring up a new command line, and make sure that your Anaconda environment is deactivated:    
`conda deactivate`  
And if you still have any problems with conda and python versions, it's possible that you will need to run this too:  
`conda config --set auto_activate_base false`  
and then from within the Agents directory, you should be able to run `uv python list` and see the Python 3.12 version.
uv python list
# First let's do an import. If you get an Import Error, double check that your Kernel is correct..

from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Next it's time to load the API keys into environment variables
# If this returns false, see the next cell!

load_dotenv(override=True)
### Wait, did that just output `False`??

If so, the most common reason is that you didn't save your `.env` file after adding the key! Be sure to have saved.

Also, make sure the `.env` file is named precisely `.env` and is in the project root directory (`agents`)

By the way, your `.env` file should have a stop symbol next to it in Cursor on the left, and that's actually a good thing: that's Cursor saying to you, "hey, I realize this is a file filled with secret information, and I'm not going to send it to an external AI to suggest changes, because your keys should not be shown to anyone else."

            3. If you ever get a Name Error in Python, you can always fix it immediately; see the last section of this <a href="../guides/06_python_foundations.ipynb">Python Foundations guide</a> and follow both tutorials and exercises.<br/>

# Congratulations!

That was a small, simple step in the direction of Agentic AI, with your new environment!

            First ask the LLM to pick a business area that might be worth exploring for an Agentic AI opportunity.<br/>
            Then ask the LLM to present a pain-point in that industry - something challenging that might be ripe for an Agentic solution.<br/>
            Finally have 3 third LLM call propose the Agentic AI solution. <br/>
            We will cover this at up-coming labs, so don't worry if you're unsure.. just give it a try!
